i being the head of household should be informed and in control of all credit requests. 
how this is not tied to my email or cell phone number is beyond ridiculous. 

lets get into this century. 
if i want to access my bank account i need a username/password and then you need to have my PHONE with a 2step verification password. 

but to open a new credit account in my name you need just some basic data ... .and then i may need to prove that i did n't open it? 

equifax breech shows you that its time to modernize your system of allowing credit based on nominal information that can be easily scraped and hacked. 

how is it allowed that people could open credit on my behalf without contacting me directly using verified contact/adress/phone/email methods? i understand that not everyone is so savvy but let me enroll in 2step as i want to actively monitor and secure my credit. not let it passively be passed around. 


its ludicrous. 
now i need to monitor my credit or freeze my credit and then pay to unfreeze? 
thats how i make sure i 'm secure? 
or pay someone else to do so?

06/06/2019,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,,"I have a home mortgage with Provident Funding and we have repeatedly run into issues with poor service and process requirements which are a detriment to their customers. 

My most recent issue : My home received wind damage to the roof from a thunderstorm. I received a claim check in the amount of $ XXXX from my insurance company made out to me and Provident Funding. I sent the check to Provident for endorsement. First, they deposited the check in their own account rather than endorsing it and sending to me. Provident then held funds for 5 days.. After which they issued a check to me AND the roofing contractor. This now forces me to only work with that roofing contractor for the full amount. I am unable to withhold funds if there are issues that I want the contractor to resolve before full payment. 

I called Provident Funding customer service. The customer service agent said that issuing to the contractor was a requirement of their investor, XXXX XXXX. I asked them to send me documentation of those requirements and they refused. ( "" We do not email our customers, even at their request. '' ) I then reviewed the posted guidelines from XXXX XXXX online and the guidelines do NOT require this. I raised the issue to the customer service manager, XXXX, and he acknowledged that the current guidelines do not require this. However, he then claimed that the posted guidelines were "" new '' and Provident was not required to follow those guidelines for another month.. Since we both agreed these were the current guidelines, I asked them to re-issue my check per the guidance from XXXX XXXX. He said that regardless of the current guidelines, Provident was not required and so, NO, they would not. He made no apology for their delay in following the guidelines. 

My complaints : - Provident provided me with false information about current guidelines. They only acknowledged the error when I researched and pointed it out to them. 
- Provident is intentionally delaying their adoption of the current guidelines for their own profit at the expense of consumers. They are doing this by holding claim money longer than needed so that they can collect interest which is not rightfully theirs. 
- The attitude from their customer service manager was poor. 
- They refused to provide me anything in writing to back up their claims. They told me to "" XXXX it '' myself.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,PROVIDENT FUNDING ASSOCIATES,FL,320XX,,Consent provided,Web,06/06/2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3266835
