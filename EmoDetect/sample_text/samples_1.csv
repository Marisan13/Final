112092,US,"Despite the moniker, this blend of Counoise, Mourvèdre, Malbec, Zinfandel and Petit Sirah strays pretty far afield from the southern Rhône. It's an edgy, stylized effort, light with tart rhubarb fruit, wild berries and plenty of tongue-tingling acidity. Yet it does not lack for flavor, detail, or interest. For acid hounds.",Chateauneuf du Stark,88,40.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine ,ENSO 2011 Chateauneuf du Stark Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),Red Blend,ENSO

115127,Portugal,"Named after the fourth Marquesa who was a noted poet, this dense and concentrated wine is all about power and intensity. It has dark tannins, bold black fruits and super-rich wood-aged flavors.

43317,Italy,"Aromas recall grilled pepper, red currant and exotic spice. The palate delivers dried black cherry, toasted oak, roasted coffee bean, anisette and espresso alongside the heat of evident alcohol. It lacks fruit richness to stand up to the oak, while raspy tannins give it an astringent, mouth-drying finish.",Filai Lunghi,87,45.0,Tuscany,Vino Nobile di Montepulciano,,Kerin O’Keefe,@kerinokeefe,Fattoria della Talosa 2011 Filai Lunghi  (Vino Nobile di Montepulciano),Sangiovese,Fattoria della Talosa
54993,US,"This is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Zinfandel. Zin provides the fuel to power the wine, while Cab lends elegance and structure.

113871,France,"Notes of fresh sourdough rye bread, crisp apples and citrus vie for attention and signal an evolved wine with beautiful notes of long autolysis. This is borne out on the exquisitely pure and fresh palate, still sprightly with lemon and green-apple freshness against a background of bread crust and crumb. Over time, the apple notes mellow and are reminiscent of spiced winter apple. This is marked by exquisite elegance and purity. Without any dosage, this shines with pure, intense and lively fruit.",Brut Zéro,93,39.0,Alsace,Crémant d'Alsace,,Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino,Zusslin 2013 Brut Zéro Sparkling (Crémant d'Alsace),Sparkling Blend,Zusslin
118607,South Africa,"Simple but solid, this Cab leads with a nose of smoked meat and pepper and follows it up with a balanced character of minerals, red fruit and wooded spice.

92248,France,"Poised, stylish and elegant, this is a wine that recalls a more leisured time. Pristine apple and citrus flavors combine easily and fresh on the palate.

86203,Spain,"This smells like plastic and milk chocolate at first, then with airing it begins to take on its classically Rioja character. It feels fresh and zesty, with a medium body and red fruit flavors that are spicy, lightly herbal and generic.

116894,Italy,"This single-vineyard Barolo shows balsamic aromas of sage, eucalyptus and leather with raspberry notes.

29826,US,"This brand reliably produces varietally correct, down-the-middle wines, and this is no exception, starting with aromas of Anjou pear, underripe honeydew, tight white-flower buds and freshly cut key lime. The ripe stone-fruit flavors on the sip are cut by citrus and wet cement, offering all the elements to please many a Sauv Blanc fan.",,88,12.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Central Coast,Matt Kettmann,@mattkettmann,SeaGlass 2016 Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Barbara County),Sauvignon Blanc,SeaGlass
91662,US,"This bottling is still very young and will vastly improve with time, but already shows many of the components that make this remote mountain-surrounded vineyard one of the more exciting slices of the region. Aromas of black currant and purple flowers are deep and heady, while the palate's richer blackberry-syrup notes are cut by a black-plum tang, fresh underbrush herbaceousness and tons of cola spice.",Colson Canyon Vineyard,91,42.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Central Coast,Matt Kettmann,@mattkettmann,Tensley 2015 Colson Canyon Vineyard Syrah (Santa Barbara County),Syrah,Tensley

63892,US,"A cool vintage shows through in the lighter style of this Merlot. Strawberry is the dominant fruit flavor, although the time in new oak is what dominates currently. The scent and vanilla flavor of American oak, though accounting just 20% of the barrels, comes across quite powerfully.
